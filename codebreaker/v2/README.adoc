= Codebreaker - v2
Codebreaker is also known as the game "Mastermind".

There is a secret code composed by 4 digits.
The player submits a guess and is returned with a 4 characters result string.
That result string gives indications on how close the guess is to the actual secret.

The result string contains a `+` if a digit is an exact match.
An exact match is a digit that matches a digit of the secret code both in value and in position.

It contains a `-` for a digit match.
A digit match is a digit that matches a digit of the secret code in value but does not have the correct position.

It does not contain anything for guessed digits that are not part of the secret.

Your task is to write a function that evaluates a guess against a secret.
The function signature should be:

[code,java]
----
String evaluate(String secret, String guess)
----
